      "D: Analyzing the global economy on a regional basis presents several drawbacks. Economic diversity within regions, which often include both high-income and low-income countries, can lead to significant variability in economic data, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. When per capita real GDP is aggregated across countries within a region, the resulting data may lack depth and fail to provide valuable insights into individual economies. This can lead to misleading comparisons, as regional analyses may not accurately reflect the unique economic attributes of each country. Furthermore, while regional economic integration can highlight benefits such as increased trade and investment opportunities, it can also overshadow the specific economic challenges faced by individual countries. Overall, regional analysis tends to be broad and may not capture the distinct economic characteristics of countries within the region, limiting its effectiveness in understanding the global economy.\n",
