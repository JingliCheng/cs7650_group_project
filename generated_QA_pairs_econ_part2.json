Do the top and bottom quintiles in this distribution have a greater or larger share of total income than the top and bottom quintiles of the U.S. income distribution?\n\n        Gold Answer: 6. \n\nA useful first step is to rank the households by income, from lowest to highest. Then, since there are 10 households total, the bottom quintile will be the bottom two households, the second quintile will be the third and fourth households, and so on up to the top quintile. The quintiles and percentage of total income for the data provided are shown in the following table. Comparing this distribution to the U.S. income distribution for 2005, the top quintile in the example has a smaller share of total income than in the U.S. distribution and the bottom quintile has a larger share.

Converting this information into a Lorenz curve, however, is a little trickier, because the Lorenz curve graphs the cumulative distribution, not the amount received by individual quintiles. Thus, as explained in the text, you have to add up the individual quintile data to convert the data to this form. The following table shows the actual calculations for the share of income in 1979 versus 1991. The figure following the table shows the perfect equality line and the Lorenz curves for 1979 and 1991.

In 1991, the cumulative shares are: bottom quintile (6.6%), second quintile (18.1%), middle quintile (34.4%), fourth quintile (57.1%), and top quintile (100%).

The group will vote for mountain biking over canoeing by 2\u20131. It will vote for canoeing over the beach by 2\u20131. If mountain biking is preferred to canoeing and canoeing is preferred to the beach, it might seem that it must be true that mountain biking is the favorite. But in a vote of the beach versus mountain biking, the beach wins by a 2\u20131 vote. When a voting cycle occurs, choosing a single favorite that is always preferred by a majority becomes impossible.\n\n        Your task: Think about the question and understand the answer first, then extract complete bullet points that are key keypoints based on the answer for rebuilding the answer from scratch for the same question, more keypoints will be helpful.

Continuing this process, we find that the optimal level of sewage emissions occurs at 4 million gallons, where marginal costs ($500,000) equal marginal benefits ($1,650,000). Enforcing zero emissions, while seemingly beneficial due to the total benefits exceeding total costs, is impractical as it ignores the economic principle of efficiency; such a law would lead to excessive costs without considering the diminishing returns of additional cleanup efforts, ultimately misallocating resources.", "To determine the optimal level of sewage emissions for the city, we apply the Cost Minimization Principle, which emphasizes minimizing costs at all levels of sewage emissions.

The optimal level of sewage emissions occurs where marginal costs equal marginal benefits, which is identified at 4 million gallons, where the marginal cost of $500,000 aligns with the marginal benefit of $1,650,000.

Draw Alphonso\u2019s new budget constraint. What happens to the opportunity cost of bus tickets?\n", "answer": "1. \nThe opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus ticket. Originally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25 burgers. The reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets ($0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25 burgers (the inverse of the opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50 burgers. You can see this graphically since the slope of the new budget constraint is steeper than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget on burgers, the higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the vertical intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he spends his entire budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so the horizontal intercept is half as much.

Draw Alphonso\u2019s new budget constraint. What happens to the opportunity cost of bus tickets?\n\n        Gold Answer: 1. \nThe opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus ticket. Originally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25 burgers. The reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets ($0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25 burgers (the inverse of the opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50 burgers. You can see this graphically since the slope of the new budget constraint is steeper than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget on burgers, the higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the vertical intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he spends his entire budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so the horizontal intercept is half as much.
